## Chess++ RPG made in PyGame.

**(the following is the description of what this game will be like when finished!)**

*This project is a pygame (GUI) chess-based RPG game. It uses chess as its base combat system, but with piece abilities, special pieces, and much more! There is adventure mode, dungeon mode, and many other game modes.*

Currently, only the chess board is implemented into the game.

This game is using [Python chess library](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess).

# Warnings

**This project is still under heavy development**, so the data structures used for caching and saving data will change. If you'd like to play this game in the Alpha version, and your saved files get out of date or just from strange bugs, your files can corrupt.

If your data folder corrupts, delete the files under `saves` folder to let the program fix it.

If your saved files go corrupt, then it's probably not going to be resolved.
