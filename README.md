# Warnings

**This project is still under heavy development**, so the data structures used for caching and saving data will change. If you'd like to play this game in the Alpha version, and your saved files get out of date or just from strange bugs, your files can corrupt.

If your data folder corrupts, delete the files under `saves` folder to let the program fix it.

If your saved files go corrupt, then it's probably not going to be resolved.
