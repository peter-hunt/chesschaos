# Contributing to ChessChaos

Welcome to the guide of contributing to ChessChaos! Below are the **rules of contributing to ChessChaos**.

# Bugs

**This project is under heavy development**, and it is you who can discover bugs and make the project better. Here are the things you should do if you find a bug.

First, **calm yourself**. Your computer isn't crashing or getting hacked. It's probably just a bug caused by my unawareness when coding something. But if you do as below, I'll get to know the bug.

Next, **post a screenshot or copy the error message**. You should describe some of your actions, so I can find the bugs easier. **Be careful to sensor your personal information because it's easy you leak your information and get yourself in danger with screenshots.** If you feel like it's needed, please also address your Operating System, Python version, and saved files.

Last, wait for responses. If you've gone to this step, then congratulations, you just made your contribution! Contributions will improve the experience of you and others and prevent the bug from being exploited or becoming worse.

# Feature Ideas or Modification Suggestions

If you have ideas about adding or improving features, address issues with tag `enhancement` about them. **I'll determine if your suggestions are helpful for the project or not.** Helpful ideas will typically apply to the following rules:
* The idea should be balanced for the game (not useless or over-powered);
* You should describe the feature clearly, like with paragraphing and listing;
* Related ideas can be posted together, but unrelated ones should be posted separately.
